## Overview

The **Automated Vulnerability Scanner** is a web application built using Flask that integrates with OWASP ZAP to perform automated security scans on specified URLs. It provides a user-friendly web interface to input target URLs and receive detailed vulnerability scan results in real-time.

## Features

- **Automated Scanning**: Utilizes OWASP ZAP to identify vulnerabilities in web applications.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple HTML form for user input.
- **Real-Time Progress Updates**: Monitor scan progress in the terminal.
- **Detailed Alerts**: JSON formatted results of vulnerabilities found during the scan.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Python 3.x**: Download and install from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework.
- **Flask-CORS**: A Flask extension for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).
- **OWASP ZAP**: The Zed Attack Proxy, a popular open-source web application security scanner.
- **Wkhtmltopdf**: You may need to install a headless browser like wkhtmltopdf for PDF generation.

## Installation Steps For macOS:

Follow these steps to get the application up and running:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open your terminal and run:

   ```
   git clone <https://github.com/tobimicheal/VulnerabilityScanner.git>
   ```
   cd <repository-directory>
2.  You can use Homebrew to install Python:

   brew install python

3.  Install Flask
   Once Python 3.x is installed, you can install Flask using pip. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
   pip install Flask

4.  Install OWASP ZAP and Configure API
   You can download the ZAP installer from the official OWASP ZAP website. Choose the appropriate installer for your operating system and follow the installation instructions.
   To use the ZAP API, start ZAP and configure the API from the ZAP interface: Go to Tools → Options → API tab, Enable API access and set the API key.
5.  Develop the Flask Web Interface
    Create a simple Flask app (app.py) that provides a form for the user to input a target URL and configure scan parameters.( The app.py is in the repository)
6. Create the Web Form (HTML)
    Create a basic HTML form (templates/index.html) that allows the user to input the target URL and start the scan: ( The index.html file is in the repository)
7. Testing the Vulnerability Scanner
   Start OWASP ZAP on your system.
   Run the Flask app by executing:
    ```
   python app.py
     ```
8.  Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000.
9.   Enter a target URL in the form and start the scan.
10.  Once the scan is complete, the scanner will generate an HTML report detailing any vulnerabilities found.
